About extundelete
extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4 partition. The ext3 and ext4 file systems are the most common default file systems in Linux distributions like Mint, Mageia, or Ubuntu. extundelete uses information stored in the partition's journal to attempt to recover a file that has been deleted from the partition. There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able to be undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system in place, or at least put one in place after recovering your files!

umount the partition ASAP ; do not mount it again.

If you turned the PC off in panic (and did not umount it), then do NOT start the PC again to "recover" and THEN umount, of course; in that case just work with the unclean image.
